# RPMs as operating system extensions, distinct from the base ostree commit/image
# https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/rhcos/extensions.md
# and https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/401

# RULE: Do not add repos to specific extensions below if the extension is not
# multi-arch, but the repos are. Instead, put them in the global repos list at
# the top. Otherwise, we can have consistency issues across arches. See e.g.
# https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-52293.

repos:
  - c9s-sig-nfv
  # Some of the extensions here have version bindings to host packages. Add the
  # mirrors since those retain multiple versions of packages in case the latest
  # compose has already moved since the last base image build.
  - c9s-baseos-mirror
  - c9s-appstream-mirror
  - c9s-nfv-mirror
